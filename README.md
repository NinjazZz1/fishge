FISHGE V0.1

This is my first project i've created on my own for fun! It is a smal webfishing game where you try to catch all the fish in pond to try level up.

UI 
- Press 'Cast' to begin the auto fishing process and watch as you catch fish battling rng.
- The 'Collection' tab shows all fish with the amount of times you have caught them.
- The 'Log' window with the rod is the main tab showing you cast out and fish caught.
- The 'Best Catch' will show the best fish you caught by value.
- The 'Stats' window will show you your level, exp required for next level and cash.

HOW IT WORKS

- When you cast out your line, a fish will be chosen in a weighted loot table. Then that fish will be a random size depeding on it's min and max size.
- The value and exp of the fish depends on the size of that fish and how rare it is.
- Some fish will only be obtainable during specific weather.
- The weather has a 10% to change after every catch (Hope you get lucky during Fog).

BUGS 

- Sometimes weather changes to 'undefined'
