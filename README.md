FISHGE V0.25

This is my first project i've created on my own for fun! It is a small webfishing game where you try to catch all the fish in pond to try level up.

UI 
- Press 'Cast' or 'Auto Fish' to begin the fishing process and watch as you catch fish battling rng.
- The 'Collection' tab shows all fish with the amount of times you have caught them.
- The 'The Grand Ocean' window with the rod is the main tab showing you cast out and fish caught.
- The 'Best Catch' will show the best fish you caught by value.

HOW IT WORKS

- When you cast out your line, a fish will be chosen in a weighted loot table. Then that fish will be a random size depeding on it's min and max size.
- The value and exp of the fish depends on the size of that fish and how rare it is.
- Some fish will only be obtainable during specific weather.
- fish have a chance to get away.
- The weather will change at 08:00, 16:00 and 00:00 according to the time at the top right.

BUGS 

- Sometimes weather changes to 'undefined'.
- When window is too small, segments will overlap.
